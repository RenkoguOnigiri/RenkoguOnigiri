Himanshu Kothari

Molecular Biology • Biochemistry • Bioinformatics

I study biological systems at the molecular level using a combination of wet-lab experimentation and computational analysis. My goal is to understand how molecular interactions scale into cellular and ecological behavior.

Current Focus

Metagenomic sequencing analysis

Protein structure and interaction prediction

Reproducible analysis pipelines

Hypothesis-driven data interpretation

Skills

Wet Lab
Cloning • Expression • Protein purification • DNA/RNA extraction • PCR

Computational
Linux • Python • R • NGS workflows • Sequence analysis • Structural prediction

Ongoing Projects

See pinned repositories below for full reproducible workflows and reports.

Research Goal

PhD in molecular microbiology / biochemical mechanisms / genomics

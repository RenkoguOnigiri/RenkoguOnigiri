**Molecular Biology • Biochemistry • Bioinformatics**

I study biological systems at the molecular level using a combination of wet-lab experimentation and computational analysis. My goal is to understand how molecular interactions scale into cellular and ecological behavior.

**_Current Focus_**

Metagenomic sequencing analysis

Protein structure and interaction prediction

Reproducible analysis pipelines

Hypothesis-driven data interpretation

**_Skills_**

**Cell Culture**
Plant Tissue Culture Virology (BSL 3) Bacteria, yeast and mammalian cells culture cultivation

**Molecular Biology**
DNA, RNA, and protein isolation PCR and RT-qPCR SDS Page Gene Cloning (Designing Plasmid Vector,
Transformation, Colony Screening) Protein Purification (IEX, SEC, IMAC, RP) Western Blots Protein Expression
